// 21Z Combining Arrays JAVASCRIPT

/* JavaScript's concat() method allows you to join arrays and create an entirely new array.

Example: */

var c1 = ["HTML", "CSS"];
var c2 = ["JS", "C++"];
var courses = c1.concat(c2);

/* The courses array that results contains 4 elements (HTML, CSS, JS, C++).
The concat operation does not affect the c1 and c2 arrays - it returns the resulting concatenation as a new array. */
