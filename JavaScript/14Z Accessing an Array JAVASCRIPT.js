// 14Z Accessing an Array JAVASCRIPT

//Attempting to access an index outside of the array, returns the value undefined.

var courses = new Array("HTML", "CSS", "JS"); 
document.write(courses[10]);
//Outputs "undefined"

// Our courses array has just 3 elements, so the 10th index, which is the 11th element, does not exist (is undefined).

// HTML CODE IS SAME
