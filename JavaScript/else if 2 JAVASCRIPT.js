/* else if 2 JAVASCRIPT */

The final else block will be executed when none of the conditions is true. 

Let's change the value of the course variable in our previous example.
var course = 3;
if (course == 1) {
   document.write("<h1>HTML Tutorial</h1>");
} else if (course == 2) {
   document.write("<h1>CSS Tutorial</h1>");
} else {
   document.write("<h1>JavaScript Tutorial</h1>");
}
