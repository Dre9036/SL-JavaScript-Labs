// JavaScript Objects JAVASCRIPT 

/* JavaScript variables are containers for data values. Objects are variables too, but they 
can contain many values.

Think of an object as a list of values that are written as name:value pairs, with the 
names and the values separated by colons.
Example: */

var person = {
 name: "John", age: 31, 
 favColor: "green", height: 183
};

// These values are called properties.
