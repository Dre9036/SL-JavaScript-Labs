// 16Z Creating Arrays PART 1 JAVASCRIPT

/* JavaScript arrays are dynamic, so you can declare an array and not pass any arguments with the Array() constructor. 
You can then add the elements dynamically. */

var courses = new Array();
courses[0] = "HTML";
courses[1] = "CSS";
courses[2] = "JS";
courses[3] = "C++";

// You can add as many elements as you need to.

//HTML CODE IS SAME
