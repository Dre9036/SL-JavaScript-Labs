// 49Z Image Slider JAVASCRIPT

/* Now we can create a sample image slider project. The images will be changed using "Next" and "Prev" buttons.
Now, letâ€™s create our HTML, which includes an image and the two navigation buttons: 

<div>
  <button> Prev </button>
  <img id="slider" src="http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/slider/1.jpg" 
    width="200px" height="100px"/>
  <button> Next </button>
</div>


Next, let's define our sample images in an array:

var images = [
   "http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/slider/1.jpg", 
   "http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/slider/2.jpg", 
   "http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/slider/3.jpg"
];

We are going to use three sample images that we have uploaded to our server. You can use any number of images. */
