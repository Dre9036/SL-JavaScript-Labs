// 20Z The length Property JAVASCRIPT 

/* JavaScript arrays have useful built-in properties and methods.

An array's length property returns the number of it's elements. */

var courses = ["HTML", "CSS", "JS"];
document.write(courses.length);
//Outputs 3

/* The length property is always one more than the highest array index.
If the array is empty, the length property returns 0. */

//HTML CODE IS SAME
