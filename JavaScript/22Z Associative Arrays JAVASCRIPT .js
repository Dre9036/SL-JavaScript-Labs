// 22Z Associative Arrays JAVASCRIPT 

/* Remember that JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes.
In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes.
It is better to use an object when you want the index to be a string (text).
Use an array when you want the index to be a number.

If you use a named index, JavaScript will redefine the array to a standard object. */
